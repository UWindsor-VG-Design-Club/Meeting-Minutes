 		Have a bot, dm a user, get their email, email them some codes and then verify with those codes.

	Board Rules of Order Changes

		Shayan can you set this up, if so when?
		Start of reading week pong or chess?
		Connor, Usman, or Julia; in their respective capacities with VGDC, can talk to Usman in his capacity as CSS Head of Events.
	Constitutional Interpretion:
		Does the Moderation authority of the Head of Community (and thus, the so called "chadmins") extend to the #board-channel
		Alternatively, is the #board-channel treated as the forum for a continuous board meeting, and thus is protected by the constitution in the same way a Board Meeting is
		Interpretation 1: The Moderation authority of the Head of Community does extend to the #board-channel, and the constitution does not protect it the same way it does a Board Meeting
		Moved By Connor Horman
		Motion abandoned as moot
		Interpretation 2: The Constitution Does protect it, and that protection supersedes the Moderation authority of the Head of Community
		Moved By Usman Farooqi
		Seconded by Allyssa
		Interpretation Adopted
	Constitution changes 
		I want to go over the constitution and change some stuff
	Game Challenge?
		Julia you were talking about this in one of the channels
		Make a game in 48hrs
		Make a scratch game in 3hrs maybe?

	GitHub page for the club
		Add everyone to the GitHub VGDC Repository
